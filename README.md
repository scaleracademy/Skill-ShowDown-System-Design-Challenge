## What is TicTacToe?

TicTacToe is a 2-player game played on a 3 x 3 board. Each player is allotted a symbol (one X and one O). Initially, the board is empty. Alternatively, each player takes a turn and puts their symbol at any empty slot. The first player to get their symbol over a complete row OR a complete column OR a diagonal wins. You can play the game within Google Search by just searching for “tic-tac-toe”!

## Problem Statement
Create a Low-Level Design for a common TicTacToe game with the following constraints as shared. 

## Problem Requirements

- Board can be of any NxN size.
- There can be any number of players. Each player will be allotted a symbol.
- The players can be either humans or bots. Each human player will have a name.
- Only one Bot is allowed per game.
- We should allow support to undo any number of moves.
- Try to implement the winner detection algorithm in O(1).

## Expectations

- The code should be working and functionally correct
- Good software design practices should be followed:
  - Code should be modular, readable, extensible
  - Separation of concern should be addressed
  - Project structured well across multiple files/ packages
- Write unit tests.
- No need for GUI.

## Interaction Format

Command Line based interactive application.

## Input/ Outputs

### Game Start

Allows to start the game with a given number of players, board size, and symbols of every player.
